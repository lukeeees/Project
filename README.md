# Coding Interview Analysis
Author: Lukeeees

# Introduction
<p>This project aims to analyze coding interviews and the emotions and behavior of the interviewee during the process. The goal is to gain insights into what factors contribute to a successful coding interview and how the interviewee's emotions and behavior can impact the outcome.
</p>

# Getting Started
<p>To get started with this project, you will need to have access to coding interview data and a system for tracking interviewee emotions and behavior during the process. You will also need a programming language such as Python and data analysis tools such as Jupyter Notebook or Vscode.
</p>

# Data Collection
<p>To collect coding interview data, you can use a variety of sources such as online coding challenge platforms like HackerRank or LeetCode, coding interview simulation platforms like InterviewBit or Gainlo, or actual coding interviews conducted by companies.
</p>
<p>To track interviewee emotions and behavior, you can use techniques such as facial recognition, sentiment analysis, and eye-tracking. You can also ask the interviewee to self-report their emotions.
</p>

# Data Analysis
<p>Once you have collected the data, you can begin analyzing it to gain insights into the factors that contribute to a successful coding interview. Some of the things you can look at include:
</p>

<p>Coding performance: How well did the interviewee perform on the coding tasks given during the interview?
Emotional state: What emotions did the interviewee exhibit during the interview? Were they nervous, confident, or frustrated?
Behavioral patterns: What were the interviewee's behaviors during the interview? Did they ask questions, seek feedback, or struggle to complete tasks?
You can use data analysis tools such as machine learning algorithms, statistical tests, and data visualization techniques to explore the data and uncover patterns and insights.
</p>

# Conclusion
<p>Analyzing coding interviews and interviewee emotions and behavior can provide valuable insights into the factors that contribute to a successful coding interview. By understanding these factors, companies can improve their interview processes and candidates can better prepare themselves for coding interviews.</p>
